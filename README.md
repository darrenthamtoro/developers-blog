## about 
In this project, I created a website which works like a social media app. The user will first land on a login page, where they get the option to login or signup to the website. Once the user is done with the login phase, they have the option to check the "Dashboard", which displays the users posts in the website. These posts include the title of their post, and the comment. These posts will also include the name of the user and the date the user posted. The user will get the option to add another post or update their previous posts. Once the user is done, they can select the "Logout" button which logs them out of the website.
